<h2><strong>Proposal</strong></h2>
<p align="justify"> Have you ever noticed that, in certain situations, you repeatedly engage in the same behavior, even though you had planned to do something different? This project was developed during the 11th edition of RocketSeat's NLW Setup with the objective of tracking habits. The habit tracker is a commitment to your personal development and the establishment of the habits you deem essential. Additionally, you'll love filling out the habit tracking table. It can become an extra motivation to see an empty square waiting to be filled. 😉 </p>
